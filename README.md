```

```candid "Type definitions" +=
type Subaccount = blob;

type Account = record {
		owner: principal; 
		subaccount: opt blob;
  };
  
type TransferArgs = record {
    spender_subaccount: opt Subaccount; // the subaccount of the caller (used to identify the spender)

    token_ids: vec {nat};   
    memo: ?Blob;
    created_at_time: opt nat64;
    is_atomic: opt bool;
  };

type TransferError = variant {
    Unauthorized: record { token_ids: vec (nat) };
    TooOld;
